# Get Started

Camber allows you to create jobs that use distributed compute engines and analyze data, at any scale all in the same cloud environment.

In the following tutorials, you will perform a simple distributed computing task using MPI.
Then, you will analyze a dataset using Spark, a popular distributed computing framework for data analysis and ML.
Finally, you will use Camber's compute cloud to make some plots.
These tutorials aim to give you a flavor of how to use the Camber platform end-to-end.

**The tutorials assume that the reader has a basic understanding of python, experience with Jupyter notebooks and a continued interest in science.**
