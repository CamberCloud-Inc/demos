    "Methylation sequencing (Methyl-Seq) is a key tool for studying DNA methylation, an essential epigenetic modification influencing gene expression and cellular function. The [nf-core/methylseq](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/3.0.0/) pipeline simplifies the analysis of Methyl-Seq data, offering a robust and reproducible workflow. Running this pipeline on the Camber platform, powered by the [Nextflow Engine](https://docs.cambercloud.com/docs/reference/python-api/nextflow/), makes it easy to perform complex bioinformatics tasks with minimal effort, providing scalability and efficiency for researchers."
